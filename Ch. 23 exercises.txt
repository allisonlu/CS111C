11/9 Homework: 2, 3, 4 (in pseudo code), 6, 7, 10

2. What is the height of the shortest binary tree that contains 21 nodes? Is this tree full? Balanced?
	height = floor(log2(21) + 1)
	=> h = floor(5.39) = 5
This tree is not full.
The tree is balanced because every leaf is the same distance away from the root as every other leaf.

3. Consider a binary tree that has three levels.
What is the maximum number of nodes in this tree?
2^3 - 1 = 7 nodes.
What is the maximum number of leaves in this tree?
4 leaves.

Answer the previous two questions for a binary tree that has 10 levels
2^10 - 1 = 1023 nodes.

(max nodes for 10 levels) - (max nodes for 9 levels)
		= (2^10 - 1) - (2^9 - 1)
		= 1023 - 511
		= 512 leaves.


4. Write a recursive algorithm that counts the nodes in a binary tree.

int getNodes(T currentNode) {
	if currentNode is null
		return 0;
	return 1 + getNodes(rightChild) + getNodes(leftChild)
}

6. Consider a traversal of a binary tree. Suppose that visiting a node means to simply display the data in the node. What are the results of each of the following traversals of the tree (a)?
Preorder
6 4 2 1 3 5 8 7 9 10 11
Postorder
1 3 2 5 4 9 7 11 10 8 6
Inorder
1 2 3 4 5 6 9 7 8 10 11
Level Order
6 4 8 2 5 7 10 1 3 9 11

7. Repeat Exercise 6, but instead traverse the tree (b).
Preorder
11 8 3 2 1 5 4 6 9 10 7
Postorder
2 1 3 4 6 5 8 9 7 10 11
Inorder
2 3 1 8 5 4 6 11 10 9 7
Level Order
11 8 10 3 5 9 7 2 1 4 6

10. Suppose we know that the preorder traversal of a binary search tree is 6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 7, 10, 9, 11. What is the postorder traversal of the tree?
1 3 4 2 9 11 10 7 6
